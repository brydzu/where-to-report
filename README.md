# Where to Report

Discovered an issue with a website, app or anything else? Want to report it to the creators but don't know where? Search here.

## Add to List

Found something missing? There are 2 ways you can add to the list:

### Experience with Github
1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit `_data/list.json` and add the missing item.

### No experience with Github
1. [Open an issue by clicking here]() (You'll need to be login on Github first).
2. Mention the **Name**, **Link to the item** and **Issue reporting link** in the issue.
3. I'll verify and add it to the list.
